    <h1>Omelette au Fromage</h1>
    <p>Today we're making an Omelette au Fromage. A French classic, this fluffy cheese omelet can be whipped up in a matter of minutes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. water</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. butter</li>
        <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
        <li>2 oz gruyere cheese</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>salt & pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Grate the cheese, using the larger holes of your grater. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Break the eggs into a bowl. Whip with a wire whip. Add the water — this lightens the omelet. Whip again until frothy.</li>
        <li>Heat the butter and olive oil to sizzling in a well-seasoned omelet pan. Let it get good and hot before adding the eggs, swirling it around to coat the sides.</li>
        <li>Pour in the eggs. Swirl. When the omelet starts to set, lift one edge with a wooden spatula to let some of the liquid slip beneath. Working quickly, repeat several times at different places around the pan. This will make the omelet fluffy.</li>
        <li>Scatter the cheese over the entire surface of the omelet. Turn the heat down to medium and continue to cook until the cheese starts to melt.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with salt (not much, as the cheese is already salty) and grind on some black pepper. Scatter with fresh herbs if using.</li>
        <li>Slip the omelet gently onto a plate, flipping the top half over the bottom. Serves one.</li>
    </ol>
